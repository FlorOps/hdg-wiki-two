# hdg-wiki-two
This is the git repo for hosting the content that creates the new HDG Guide to replace the existing WikiJS instance. It is built with hugo (currently version 0.138.0). Pages are stored in Markdown fomart according to the Commonmark specification, with some bespoke additions to support the HDG guide. Pages are stored under the `content/` directory, with folders deliniating groups and an `index.md` page serving as the home for that folder. 

Please open any issies, bugs, or requests for new features in the "Issues" tab in github, and feel free to grab an issue you see there and push a fix, as well! 

Happy Guiding!
