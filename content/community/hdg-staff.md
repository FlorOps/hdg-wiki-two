I’ve been on the internet for years. You really suck at this. I’m not offering to help of course, just trying to undermine your free labor."_

One of the decisions made by HDG's early creators was to keep the setting somewhat centralized in order to facilitate the collaborative storytelling for any creative who wanted to get involved. This meant that anyone in the community who wanted to write HDG could - not just as a fanwork, but as part of the living, evolving setting. At the same time, this also led to the need for a certain amount of high-level organization for directing and guiding the setting as it continued to grow in those early days, to say nothing of the general community management needs which arose.

If you have been following around since those days, you may have noticed that HDG has grown *considerably* over the past few years. Nowadays, the HDG community is comprised of hundreds of authors and thousands of community members on just the community server alone, and as part of that, the leadership has also grown with the needs of the community. Nowadays, that leadership is responsible for maintaining resources such as this site as well as the official [HDG Community Server](http://discord.humandomestication.guide/).
## HDG Leadership
Each member of the HDG staff is part of one (or more) of the three groups which each work with each other to help manage the setting in their own way - the **Lorets**, the **Clerks**, and the **Gardeners**. These groups are drawn from both the early creators of the setting and the many wonderful members of the community who have come onboard since, with the teams regularly growing to meet the needs of the ever-expanding community.

The **Lorets** are the setting's guides and curators, maintaining the [[writing-in-hdg|guidelines and lore]] which make HDG what it is. They also are responsible for projects such as this site to help creatives write and create art in the setting, as well as hanging out on the community server answering folks' questions and pointing them to stories which may pique their interest.

> The **Coordinators** are a small team of Lorets created to facilitate the transition from the old HDG Wiki to the new HDG Guide (the site you're on right now!). They are responsible for keeping the operations of the site running, as well as directing and organizing the guide's artists, writers, and other contributors for the creation and expansion of the content on the Guide.

The **Clerks** are the team who are in charge of the operations of the community server, helping manage its hundreds of users active every day and keeping it a lovely space for folks to discuss the setting and the stories within. They handle the high-level policy decisions like the rules and channel layouts, as well as a variety of general moderation responsibilities.

Finally, the most recent team to join the staff are the **Gardeners**, who assist the Clerks in the day-to-day moderation and management of the server. They are the backbone of keeping the Community Server a safe and vibrant place for the the community.

teagan is the main organizer of the content of this site - if a word is in the Guide, it's gone through teagan's desk. It has been reading since the original story showed up on ROM and is most known for its work as a Loret and its romance novel [*Courtship*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/48043465/).
