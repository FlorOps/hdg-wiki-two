description: A test post by skoof!
---
Hello! My name is skoof! I am typing up a blog page, bleep bloop!
This the is the page I use to test things when I don't want them to disturb the rest of the site, although inevitably I end up disturbing the site *anyways* which is a pain. 

We can go to the [[Foundational Works]] !

So, I wonder what happens when I add more body text! 

# What do the different headings look like! 
## Heading two!
### Heading Three! 
#### Heading Four!!!! Wow that's a lot of headings!! 

**This text is bold!**

*This text is italic!*

~~Strikethtough? Yes!~~

What other kinds of markdown formatting are there... hmmmmmm. I dunno. Probably lots!!! 

`Oh! Code Blocks! Bleep Bloop!`
```Also bigger code blocks!!!```
