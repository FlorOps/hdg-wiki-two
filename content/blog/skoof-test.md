## Introduction
I like to put an introduction, or really any `h2` here because it makes the spacing more pleasing. With that said: Hello! My name is skoof! I am typing up a blog page, bleep bloop!

This the is the page I use to test things when I don't want them to disturb the rest of the site, although inevitably I end up disturbing the site *anyways* which is a pain. 




> [!QUOTATION]
> I think that the best story in HDG is Courtship because it respects Everly's consent. Miss Adriss would never lead Everly astray!
{link="https://archiveofourown.org" caption="- Courtship Chapter 2"}

Yeah!!! 100% 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

Well would you look at that! Let's try them all! 

> [!NOTE]
> Useful things to know I guess

Yeah I don't know when we would use notes

> [!AFFINI]
> This one is for the affini and I'm going to make it red!

Wow, so red! Look at that!

>[!LORET]
> I think that Sweet like Cocoa is pretty hot, actually

That's a good take! 

>[!QUESTION]
> I am asking a question!!! What if the affini weren't so big?? Like, what if they were really really small? 

>[!ANSWER]
> The affini are big. They could be little too but like. they're usually big!

>[!LORET]
> I think that Sweet like Cocoa is pretty hot, actually. And like when you think about it, Aiko really deserved what she got, I mean she *was* being so very silly, I think her affini was *absolutely* justified in doing what she did. Besides, look at how happy she is for it, now!

# What do the different headings look like!

#### Heading Four!!!! Wow that's a lot of headings!! 

**This text is bold!**

~~Strikethtough? Yes!~~

What other kinds of markdown formatting are there... hmmmmmm. I dunno. Probably lots!!! 

`Oh! Code Blocks! Bleep Bloop!`
```Also bigger code blocks!!!```

We can  link to pages with `((faq|custom text))!` using square brackets instead of round (lol I can't use square or the parser will grab it even if I use an escape character, maybe that should be a todo!), which will render as [[faq|custom text]]!. We can also use page anchors like this `((Foundational Works#human-domestication-guide|anchors!))` which will render as such: [[Foundational Works#human-domestication-guide|anchors!]]
