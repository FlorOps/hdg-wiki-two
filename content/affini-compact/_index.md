(TODO - opening quote)

The **Affini Compact** is a trans-galactic civilization originating in the Triangulum Galaxy, the primary cultural objective of which is the subordination and conservation of all sophont life in the universe under Affini care. With over 100,000 years of history and a territory spanning not only the Andromeda supergalaxy but also its galactic satellites, the Affini Compact has in recent years (roughly 500 years ago) begun the long-awaited process of bringing the Milky Way supergalaxy and its galactic satellites into the fold. 
## Introduction
The Compact is a radically decentralized imperial culture rather than a centrally controlled state, with individual regions and even individuals worlds and ships left to address the common task of **universal domestication** as best they see fit. Such a society would inevitably fling itself apart from sheer inertia were it not for the [[compact-bureaucracy|Bureaucracy]], which acts as a mediating and unifying force that serves simultaneously as the institutional memory and connective tissue of the Compact. _Everything_ in the Compact is tracked, documented, and archived; given time and effort, one could dig up inconsequential details of a luncheon meeting from fifty thousand years prior without much difficulty. 

The long memory and cultural mania for [[florets-domestication|domestication]] combine with a technological base that outstrips all other species; while the Compact has not achieved absolute mastery of physics and continues to make advances in all fields of science, broadly speaking it is almost universally more advanced than other cultures it encounters. Even when those cultures boast some technological development that achieves parity with the Affini in narrow niches, such cultures cannot hope to resist the advance of Affini control, care, and domestication due to the sheer logistics of the Compact. Even a species that could, theoretically, fight toe to toe with the Compact would succumb to the sheer weight of inevitability when faced with the resources the broader Compact is able to bring to bear. 
### Universal Domestication
_Main Article: [[florets-domestication|Florets & Domestication]]_

The purpose of the Compact is nothing less than to ensure that every sophont in the universe is cared for to the highest possible standard, is able to self-actualize and become the best version of themself, and to be as happy as is possible. Having had a great deal of time to think about how best to tackle this problem, the Affini have long since concluded that the optimal answer is universal domestication - in other words, for all other sophonts in the universe to accept that the Affini know best, that they naturally belong in charge, and that everyone will agree that it's better this way. 

The really irritating part about this ideology, for those on the outside looking in, is that reality seems to agree with the Affini. 

Domestication, on a cultural level, is the process of altering a sophont society to achieve not merely reflexive submission to Affini ethics, but to inculcate those ethics into that culture's fabric. The Affini will always be present to lend a hand and to care for the culture, but a fully domesticated culture will eventually be allowed to simply "do its own thing," for the most part. After all, the Affini will have ensured that "its own thing" is the best thing for that culture to be doing! 

This differs from individual domestication, the process of taming and altering a specific sophont that cannot otherwise adapt to Affini ethics. These _[[florets-domestication|florets]]_ become the property of a specific [[affini|affini]] (or, sometimes, more than one affini), who care for the floret in question as a beloved pet, fulfill their every possible need, and train them to become the best version of themselves (regardless of how much alteration of the original sophont is required to achieve that end).
## Life in the Compact 
The Affini Compact is post-scarcity - that is, they are not limited by material considerations when it comes to provided for the needs and desires of their population, Affini or otherwise. The only real limitation on what the Affini can do is on throughput, which is simply a question of logistics, and the Affini are _extremely_ good at logistics. In practice, therefore, this is generally no limitation at all. As capitalism is considered a social malfunction by the Compact, no sophont need work to meet their needs. All is provided gratis, and the work sophonts do, they do for the love of the trade (or for other, personal reasons). 

The Compact, being a spacefaring species since prehistoric times by human standards, has long since solved virtually every problem associated with living in space. Consequently, population centers in the Compact span planetary surfaces, space stations, asteroid habitats, megastructures, and more. While the Milky Way is generally rustic by comparison to the rest of the Compact, with relatively few megastructures per cubic kiloparsec, many Compact sophonts still dwell in what would be considered by Terrans to be mindbogglingly large station and ship habitats. 

The Compact is connected by a hyperluminal ansible overnet, and while this network is not without latency, especially over longer distances, it does maintain strong socio-cultural connections between otherwise quite distant sectors of Compact space. Entire fields of study exist simply to study the flow of memes back and forth between different subcutures. 
### Social Class in the Compact 
While the Compact has shed every vestige of capitalism, it has not eliminated class. While **the Affini** would be quick to point out that they do not consider themselves inherently _superior_ to other sophonts, they nevertheless are without question in overall control of not only the Compact but all worlds and cultures within it. 

Beneath them are **independent sophonts**, culturally domesticated individuals who are free to live their lives as best they see fit, having adapted to the Compact's way of life (or having been born to it). This class comprises the majority of sophonts in the Compact, and they have very little limitation on what they can accomplish save what morality (if they experience it) and time impose. Affini will almost always win that race in the end, but independent sophonts are entirely capable of specializing in a field above and beyond what an individual affini may choose to do so. 

Finally, beneath independent sophonts are **florets**, individuals domesticated and reduced to the property of an affini. "Beneath" is something of a misnomer, however, as while florets may yield all political rights they are nevertheless the center of their owners' lives, and therefore paradoxically the most important sophonts in the Compact. Any affini, not just their owner, will drop whatever they are doing if they perceive a floret to be in distress, and will do anything in their power to solve whatever problem they may have. 
## History
Over 100,000 years ago, the Affini evolved on a planet in Triangulum. They co-evolved with another sophont species, known by Terrans as "[[beeple|beeple]]" (for "bee people"). This symbiotic relationship drove the evolution of both species, with the proto-affini caring for their beeple even after they developed motility, civilization, and eventually industrialized. 

The running joke among affini is that the great project of universal domestication likely had its origins in a single beeple pointing up at the stars and wanting to go see them up close, providing the impetus for the Affini to develop spacefaring technology. Whatever the original reason, around 100,000 years ago the Affini spread out into the stars, discovered other [[sophont-species|sophont species]], and began to domesticate them just as they had the beeple. By the modern day, the Core Worlds are so highly developed that even Affini from the frontier find them somewhat numinous and eldritch, possessing a biorhythm all their own that one cannot help but fall into step with. 

From Triangulum, the Affini eventually spread to Andromeda, and from there to Andromeda's satellite galaxies. They finally arrived in the Milky Way, after a journey of two and a half million light years, circa 2000 CE (~550 BT), and began constructing a trans-galactic jumpgate to enable fast travel between Andromeda and the Milky Way. From there, they continued their common task of universal domestication, eventually reaching Terran space around 2547 C.E. 
### Future History 
An affini might rest on occasion, but the Compact never does, reaching out further and further into the stars, domesticating more and more of the galaxy for the next 400,000 years. This campaign comes to an end not because it fails, but because it succeeds beyond its wildest dreams - in the end, the Affini domesticate space-time itself, reprogramming the universe itself to create a new one in its place, one where every sophont who has ever lived finally achieves the peace, stability, and plenty that comes of domestication.

The Compact is radically decentralized, and governance tends to be direct and extremely democratic. Every citizen of the Compact is entitled to their vote (even florets, though their votes are just for fun). In smaller communities, such as aboard ships or smaller stations, or in matters concerning an individual community within a larger polity, this process is direct, with every sophont involved able to comment, argue, and vote on the outcome. Terrans might recognize this as anarcho-communist commune-style organization, and plenty of other sophont cultures have developed their own versions of it independently. 

These communes, especially aboard ships, usually have an elected position for situations that require quick decisions, centralized decision making, etc.; aboard ships, this position is almost always referred to as "Captain," though it's a far cry from the kind of tyrannical powers a Terran ship captain possesses. An affini captain is entrusted with power by the community, and can be instantly recalled by that community if they prove not to be up to the task. As a result, an affini captain (or an affini holding a similar position) are almost universally respected and extremely competent; they have to be in order to be trusted with the position in the first place, and they have to maintain that respect and competence to continue to hold it. 

Larger groups of sophonts, naturally, struggle to organize with fully demarchic principles; in these cases, therefore, councils are formed, with specialists in a given field assuming responsibility for tasks associated with it and general councils handling the affairs of overall governance and organization, with the Bureaucracy providing support when it comes to determining standards, maintaining institutional memory, and generally Doing Things Properly. Large issues are still presented to the populace for plebescite. 

Sophont cultures domesticated by the Affini are organized into Protectorates covering their general area of space. Governance in a Protectorate varies largely based on how cooperative the sophont culture was when the Affini arrived. If they were fully cooperative, and easily internalized Compact ethics, they may be permitted to maintain some semblance of self-government; if they resisted, they will be directly managed by the Affini until they can be trusted to run even basic decision-making processes by themselves. The details of a Protectorate's governance are always spelled out in that sophont culture's domestication treaty. 

It should be noted that, even in Protectorates that are permitted self-government, the Affini are ultimately still in charge; if they see a sophont culture drifting away from the Affini vision for them, they will swiftly correct it.

*Main Article: [[compact-bureaucracy|Compact Bureaucracy]]*

The Bureaucracy is nothing less than the heart of the Affini Compact. Behind all the committees and councils and votes, behind all the domestication armadas, behind everything the Compact does, the clerks and record keepers go about their appointed tasks making sure it all performs like a well-oiled machine. The Bureaucracy holds the Compact together, and the Bureaucracy drives it ever onward. The Bureaucracy is the preferred vehicle of choice for inter-Affini flirtation and the formal stamp of approval on each and every domestication. The Bureaucracy is _everything._

Except a hindrance. 

The Bureaucracy never gets in the way of the right thing. The Bureaucracy never stops what a sophont _needs_ from happening. The Bureaucracy never clings to hidebound rules that don't apply. The Bureaucracy never favors a friend over a stranger. The Bureaucracy is never a paperwork barrier for anxious sophonts (because the Affini will happily handle it all for you without telling you). The Bureaucracy is perhaps the single greatest achievement of Affini culture - it is a machine that will adjust itself as needed to ensure the best outcome for everyone involved. At least, by Affini standards. 
## Starships of the Compact
*Main Article: [[affini-ships|Affini Ships]]*

The Affini fleet is the ever-advancing vine of domestication, thousands upon thousands upon thousands of ships, each of them a miniature world unto themselves. Unlike terrans, Affini don't mass-produce copies of a particular class of ship; every ship in the fleet, like every tree in a forest, is unique in subtle ways. Grown in star gardens, materials stripped from cometary ice and lifted from stellar coronae, every Affini ship is a work of art as well as a home. 
### Survey Fleets
The forerunners of domestication, survey fleets are small detachments based around a single command ship (for which the Fleet is generally named, such as _Survey Fleet Telonema_). A survey fleet's job is to venture out into unexplored space, looking for new sophont cultures in need of domestication. Once they locate one, standard practice is to report it to other fleets, who can converge and begin the process of cotyledon selection; however, circumstances often result in a survey fleet beginning that process themselves, typically through rescue of an injured or lost sophont. 
### Domestication Armadas
The Affini do not take domestication lightly, and they leave nothing to chance. When a new sophont culture is discovered, ships will gather from across kiloparsecs and even further. They study the new species through cotyledons, learn everything they can of their culture and needs, and when they have what they need and a sufficiency of affini have gathered, contact is made. If overwhelming force is necessary, they bring it to bear; otherwise, the gathered armada happily engages directly in the work of improving the lives of the locals and bringing them into the Compact as a Protectorate. 

Even when force is required to domesticate a sophont culture, however, the vast majority of domestication armadas would never describe themselves as a military operation. Most species simply cannot offer a sufficient resistance to the Affini to necessitate a response by the specialist forces that the Affini consider military, who are typically occupied protecting key infrastructure like the transgalactic jumpgate at Sagittarius A* in the Milky Way's core. Most Domestication Armadas are functionally the equivalent of the local animal control service van - a cage trap may seem like overwhelming force to a sad, wet kitten under a house, but to the animal control specialist it's a fairly simple and straightforward tool that has absolutely no military application whatsoever. 

On the rare occasion that a new sophont species *does* occasion a response by the Affini equivalent of a military, the Compact is able to bring weaponry to bear that physics as terrans understand it is simply not equipped to explain. The Compact does not do so lightly, and never in a cavalier manner, and never in a way that costs even one more life than absolutely and strictly necessary. The ideal Compact military operation has zero casualties, and the Affini have had 100,000 years to practice that kind of control.
