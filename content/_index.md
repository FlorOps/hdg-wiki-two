Welcome to the new and improved HDG guide, nerd! We've been working very hard on improving every asepct of the site, including a complete port to a much more suitable *Static Site Generator* model instead of WikiJS! We're still ironing out the kinks, but in the mean time, you can look at some of our pages: 

{{< aside doe_plush "A skoof, doing skoof things" >}}
    Pictured: One skoof, *skoofing it*. Colourised, 1782. Honk honk honk honk!
{{< /aside >}}

Go see the [[Foundational Works]] page, or look at the [[Timeline]]. Those are both pages that exist! You could also look at [[faq|our Frequently Asked Questions]], or maybe learn about [[Sophont Species|some sophont species! ]]

## We can also have full-page images:

{{< image doe_plush "A skoof, doing skoof things" >}}
    Pictured: One skoof, continuing to *skoof it*. Colourized, 1992.
