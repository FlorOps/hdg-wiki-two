Welcome to the new and improved HDG guide, nerd! We've been working very hard on improving every asepct of the site, including a complete port to a much more suitable *Static Site Generator* model instead of WikiJS! We're still ironing out the kinks, but in the mean time, you can look at some of our pages: 

{{< aside doe_plush "A skoof, doing skoof things" >}}
    Pictured: One skoof, *skoofing it*. Colourised, 1782. Honk honk honk honk!
{{< /aside >}}

Go see the [[Foundational Works]] page, or look at [[Test]]. Those are both pages that exist! You could also look at [[faq|our Frequently Asked Questions]], or maybe learn about [[Sophont Species|some sophont species! ]]

We can  link to pages with `((Archives|custom text))!` using square brackets instead of round (lol I can't use square or the parser will grab it even if I use an escape character, maybe that should be a todo!), which will render as [[Archives|custom text]]!. We can also use page anchors like this `((Foundational Works#human-domestication-guide|anchors!))` which will render as such: [[Foundational Works#human-domestication-guide|anchors!]]

## Yup, we have headings too! 
In fact we have everything! We have quote blocks!
> Yup, this sure is a quote! 
> - skoof, 2556

and we can also have code blocks! `beep boop I am a code block!`
Ideally, some of these things will get different colours! 

## We can also have full-page images:

{{< image doe_plush "A skoof, doing skoof things" >}}
    Pictured: One skoof, continuing to *skoof it*. Colourized, 1992.
{{< /image >}}

### Can we get the nice stylized alerts we had on the old site?
> [!ALERT] 
> alerttttt

Not yet, but hopefully one day soon!
