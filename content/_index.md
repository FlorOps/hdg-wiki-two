# Welcome!!!
welcome to the hdg wiki, nerd. Go see the [[Foundational Works]] page, or look at [[Test]].

You can also look at our [[Archives]]!! Which we might want to rename "timeline" but idk. 

You can also link to pages with [[Archives|custom text]]! And with [[Foundational Works#human-domestication-guide|anchors!]]
