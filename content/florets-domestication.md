description: The processes by which the Affini care for sophont life, both on the level of an individual and the level of a culture.
---
Domestication is a complex topic, befitting the central unpinning motivation and reason for the Affini Compact's existence. It can refer both to the domestication of individuals as well as to the domestication of entire sophont cultures. In both cases, the central purpose of domestication is to improve the lives of the xenosophonts in question, a task for which the Affini are happily very well suited. 
## Domestication of Sophonts
> "Exactly as the term would indicate, Ms. Gale. Domestication is the primary purpose of the Affini Compact. To be explicit about it, in broad terms, we take in adorable sophont species who struggle to care for themselves, like humans, and use our overwhelming technological and resource advantages to eliminate resistance to Affini control in order to ensure they are properly cared for. But most importantly, on an individual basis, domestication refers to the process by which we use our expertise in biomedical engineering and xenodrug development to turn sophonts into happy, docile and loving pets for their Affini owners."

A sophont who has been domesticated is referred to as a *floret*. Most florets are xenosophonts, but occasionally an affini becomes a floret as well. As a floret, a sophont is the property of a specific affini (or, in some cases, more than one affini). That affini has absolute authority over their floret, and is charged both with ensuring the floret's well-being and shaping the floret into the best version of themselves, whatever that may be and by whatever means are necessary. 

Florets take the surname of their owner (or the closest equivalent, should a culture not have a concept directly analogous to the surname), and add a numerical quantifier to their name identifying in what order they were taken as a floret by that affini; for example, if Kasey Connor is domesticated by Thyrsiflora Abronia, Third Bloom, who has taken two florets already, they would become Kasey Abronia, Third Floret. 

> Floret counts are a personal matter, and many affini do them differently. An affini might maintain a constant floret count, and just deal with the fact that, at some point in their future, they'll have a 25th floret, and a 47th floret, and a 108th floret, and so on. Others reset their floret counts when they rebloom, or at regular intervals. Some only count the florets they currently have, resetting whenever they have none. In other words, whatever works, works. 

Florets are the beloved pets of their affini, who will stop at nothing to ensure that they are happy, but this is a responsiblity all affini feel toward all florets. If a floret is in danger, or even just a little sad, _any_ affini will prioritize solving the problem above all else. However, florets are also the property of their affini; therefore, said affini has the ultimate say in every part of a floret's life. They will alter the floret however they believe necessary to achieve their goal of allowing them to be their best self, regardless of whether the floret _wants_ those alterations beforehand. 
### Involuntary Domestication 
Most individual domestications are voluntary; a floret goes to a domestication center and volunteers, or meets an affini they feel a deep connection with and chooses to be their floret. Some xenosophonts, however, do not adapt so well to the Affini Compact that they choose this path; some adapt so poorly that the adaptation must be done _for_ them, via involuntary domestication. There are several paths to involuntary domestication, a process that is largely handled locally and by a committee of experts in wellness for the local xenosphont species. 

One such route is the _wellness check_; if a xenosophont is not thriving, is unable to care for themselves, or is otherwise experiencing trouble managing their own life that they cannot solve for themselves, they will be reported to the **Bureau of Xenosophont Wellness**, either by a concerned passerby or by the Compact's universal surveillance AI watchdogs. An affini social worker will check in on the sophont personally, evaluate their situation, provide whatever immediate care is necessary, and file the necessary paperwork. Some xenosophonts can right themselves with a simple nudge from a care worker; those who cannot are pulled into the wardship pipeline. 

A _wardship_ is essentially a temporary domestication; an affini takes charge of the xenosophont in question and acts as their guardian for the duration of the wardship, evaluating their needs, their capacity to fulfill those needs, and whether they're likely to develop those capacities with assistance or not. Xenosophonts in wardships are often given collars or cuffs that track their vital signs and are capable of delivering preloaded doses of xenodrugs in emergency situations. 

> It's a common joke that wardships are just an excuse for domestication, and to be sure that sort of thing does happen; an affini sees a xenosophont they like and arranges for them to be wellness checked, placed in a wardship under them, and subsequently domesticates them. This is less common than one might think, though, and many wardships do in fact end with the xenosophont remaining independent. The frequency of wardship-to-floret events seen in Human Domestication Guide is simply a factor of writers knowing what they want to see, and writing it. 

Involuntary domestications may also happen directly, without the wardship pipeline. This is most common early on in domestication campaigns, when some xenosophont species choose to resist domestication when the Affini arrive. However, even after cultural domestication, a xenosophont who resorts to violence (especially against affini, and _especially_ especially against florets!) will often be summarily domesticated. Other feral behaviors, such as spreading anti-Affini propaganda or attempting to subvert organs of bureaucracy, may have the same result. The conditions for when xenosophonts can be summarily domesticated are spelled out in that xenosophont's relevant Domestication Treaty. 
### Domestication Contracts
The Affini are culturally obsessed with bureaucracy and paperwork, so it should come as no surprise that one of the central features of taking a floret involves a contract spelling out in exact terms what the relationship between the floret and their owner will be. While each contract is unique and lovingly drawn up by a floret-to-be's affini, there are several standard terms that virtually all such contracts contain. This example is drawn from chapter 7 of [_Human Domestication Guide_](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45190954/chapters/134224312). 

> - Above all else, you, \[floret's first name here\], must obey your Guardian, \[Affini name here\] in all things. This is for your safety, wellbeing, and care. 
> - Your Guardian, \[Affini name here\], owns you. You are her property. You do not have political rights in the Affini Compact. 
> - You do have a guarantee of your wellbeing, as defined in ยง 57 of the Human Domestication Treaty. 
> - This guarantee of wellbeing does not preclude your Guardian from disciplining you, as outlined in ยง 61 of the HUman Domestication Treaty. 
> - As the property of your Guardian, she may add, remove, or modify conditions your wardship at any time for any reason within the limits established by the Human Domestication Treaty. 
> - Your full name is \[floret's full name here\] from this moment forward. 

Other terms may be added as the affini taking the floret desires. If the floret has volunteered, they often have a great deal of leeway to negotiate stipulations of their own. 

> The "political rights" that florets give up are nebulous at best. While florets do get a vote (for fun!), that vote doesn't count; however, if a substantial proportion of florets vote against something, the affini don't simply ignore it. These are _florets_ we're talking about, after all! 
### Florets of All Kinds 
There are several modifiers one may encounter after a floret's name, such as "Pinnate" or "Pluribus." These are terms that further specify conditions relating to, or further identify, a floret. These terms are considered so central to the floret's identity that they are formally encoded in their name. 
#### Connivents
Connivents are florets belonging to the same affini. For example, if Kasey Abronia is Thrysiflora Abronia's Third Floret, her First and Second Florets are Kasey's connivents. There is no further implied relationship between connivents, and so this term is not added to a floret's name; it's simply an umbrella category. 
#### Pinnates
A pinnate is a xenosophont to whom a floret is so attached that they cannot be ethically separated from one another. Strictly speaking, any xenosophont pair (or more) may be pinnates with each other, but when speaking of florets the information is considered important enough to be encoded in the floret's name or names. For example, if Kasey Abronia's partner, Lee Abronia, was also domesticated by Thyrsiflora, they would Lee and Kasey Abronia, Second and Third Florets Pinnate. 

If two florets belonging to two different affini fall in love or otherwise become emotionally interdependent to the degree that they're considered pinnates, their owners will typically rearrange their lives to ensure that the two can maintain regular contact. In such cases, bespoke naming schemes may be employed; if both are First Florets, for example, they might be referred to collectively as First Florets Pinnate following their names. 
#### Pluribus
Pluribus is the term the Affini use to describe multiple sophonts sharing a single body. This is another term that applies both to florets and non-florets, and which is encoded in a floret's name. There is no standard, since every pluribus system is unique, and consequently the way their name is encoded must be unique as well. However, it usually follows the same formula as "Pinnate," being applied following a floret's numerical identifier. 
#### Digital Florets
Not all florets are biological in origin! Some xenosophonts originate from artificial substrates, while others were converted to such a substrate through **digitization**. Digital florets may exist entirely as information, or may interact with the physical world through a variety of drone shells, which may be obviously artificial or indistinguishable from the biological. 
## Domestication of Cultures 
> _She had completely underestimated how powerful the Affini obsession with florets was, how all-encompassing. It wasnโt just preventing extinctions and taking as many florets as they felt like โ it included all potential florets as well, regardless of whether they wanted to be florets or not. They believe that itโs their responsibility to make every living being in the universe happy, one way or another. How had she not seen it? All the details were there. Her brain simply hadnโt joined them up properly._

> _There was no way out of this. There was never any negotiation possible beyond a polite fiction, because the Affini would never settle for anything else than absolute power to spoil Solstice rotten._

The primary drive of the Affini Compact, and of the Affini themselves, is domestication. Domesticating individuals is all well and good, but it stops short of what the Compact's true goal is: everyone should get to live well, to enjoy life, to self-actualize, to pursue their dreams, and to share their lives with one another. To accomplish these ends, the affini domesticate not just individuals but whole societies, reshaping them in ways subtle and not-so-subtle. 

The process begins with a **cotyledon program**, a quiet campaign of rescue and, if necessary, abduction. This provides the affini with test subjects to determine a species needs, develop a medical corpus for them, and so on. When they are prepared to do so, usually after a few years of study, they make contact with the species in question. 

Choice is important to the affini, and they offer it to each species when they make contact. The choice they offer is to willingly become a protectorate of the Compact or to be forcibly domesticated. They naturally allow negotiations as well, though they keep a time limit on that; good behavior earns a civilization more time for negotiation, while bad behavior results in less. Either way, the affini get what they want; a strict treaty resulting from bad behavior that contains exactly what they want, or a nice, long, drawn-out process of cultural-level bureaucratic flirtation that results in a treaty that contains exactly what they want anyway. 

The affini always get what they want. "Bad behavior" in this context means "not doing what the affini want" and "good behavior" means "doing what the affini want." The only route to a long negotiation is to spend time negotiating away the things that the affini would be taking anyway. 

For example, compare the spectrum jellies vs. the Terrand Accord. When contacted by the Compact, the spectrum jullies joined the Compact willingly, and were permitted to maintain a high degree of self-governance as overseen by the affini. The Terran Accord, meanwhile, resisted right up until the Compact's fleet arrived in the Sol System and forced the government to sign the Human Domestication Treaty, and the authority reserved to human self-government as a consequence was the right to choose the color and shape of the flag of the Terran Protectorate. 

Part of the process of cultural domestication is the assimilation of all of a culture's information into the Compact's own records. This is handled by the **Office of Transitional Neoxenoveterinary Archeobrueaucracy**, which scours all records, important or otherwise, sorting and collating and connecting everything there is to know about a species on a cultural and individual level. This office is then folded into the broader Bureaucracy when its mission is completed. 

*Feralism* is post-domestication behavior opposing the Affini Compact and the affini mission of universal domestication. Since the affini define "domestication" as taking place the moment they make first contact, any negative behavior towards the affini that a xenosophont shows is considered feral behavior. Every species displays some degree of feralism, even the ones that join willingly, and so the Compact is extremely practiced at culling feral ideologies and behaviors (though the work can take some time, especially for species more culturally primed for feral behaviors such as terrans). 
### Domestication Treaties 
A domestication treaty is functionally a domestication contract for an entire xenosophont species and culture. It serves as a framework for the domesticated civilization to understand their role in the universe (which is to say, subordinate to the affini, who care for them). For the affini, it has a very different purpose. Each treaty's provisions and stipulations form a resource for the affini when dealing with that species on a cultural and individual level. Each treaty is, therefore, a guidebook to the domestication of the species it concerns.
