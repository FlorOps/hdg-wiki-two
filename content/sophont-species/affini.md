## Appearance & Physiology
Affini are a morphologically-variable species of sophont plant-analogue organisms. They are heavily engineered and bear little resemblance, if any, to their ancestral form (discussed below); a modern affini is essentially a **phytotech** (plant-tech) cyborg consisting of a central core surrounded by vines, bark, and other foliage, all of which can be controlled and reshaped by the affini at any time. As a result, affini are functionally shapeshifters, able to remodel themselves however they wish. In practice, they often use this ability to mimic whatever sophont species they are interacting with, though some affini find a shape they particularly like and stick with it regardless of the local [[sophont-species|sophont]] population. 

As a necessity of their physiology, affini are exceptional multitaskers. In addition, being so heavily engineered, they are almost always stronger, faster, and tougher than naturally evolved sophont species. On rare occasions, xenosophonts will be the physical equal of the average affini in one way or another; for occasions such as this, some affini augment their capabilities well beyond the standing norm. Most affini are able to sustain themselves on only nutritionally enhanced water, but some affini do consume plant or animal matter to sustain themselves as well. 

Affini senses are extremely sharp. While they commonly shape eyes that appear to be made out of a kind of hammered metal, and which shine in a number of colors that vary with the affini's emotional state, these eyes are not their primary visual organs, and instead serve as fascinators used to attract and hypnotize other sophonts (see **Biorhythms & Hypnotics**, below). Affini vision is instead a function of ancestral photosynthesis. Every vine and every leaf an affini has is sensitive to light, and so they effectively see with their entire body. Their vines are also sensitive to vibrations, and therefore sound, as well as tactile stimulation. Affini often host many other senses through grafts (see below). 
### Grafts

As engineered plant-like organisms, affini are able to graft most other plant-like organisms to themselves. This is typically an outpatient operation, and functions much like grafting in terran plants; a vine is cut, the new graft is put in place and bound to the vine, and the two grow together. The affini integrates the new graft into their body and is able to manipulate it much like they do the rest of their body.

Grafts may have many purposes. Some are purely for fashion, with flowers or other visually distinctive plants added to the affini. Others will have a specific purpose; they may be a phytotech augmentation, extending the affini's capabilities beyond the norm (such as adding a digestive tract allowing them to digest food, for example). The most common example of this latter type of graft is a [[xenodrugs|xenodrug]] graft, which gives the affini a built-in means of delivering an appropriate dose of xenodrugs to a sophont. 
### Biorhythm & Hypnotics

All organisms have a biorhythm, the sum total of all the little motions of living: breathing, heartbeats, small movements, and so on. Affini are no different, and also have a biorhythm; however, unlike most organisms, the affini evolved a hypnotic biorhythm, and their engineered nature has augmented that natural hypnotic ability to extreme levels. As a result, all affini are naturally hypnotic, a trait they use to great effect in their [[florets-domestication|domestication]] of other sophont species. 

An affini's eyes are a common focal point for this hypnosis, but it is far from the only tool in their arsenal. Their voices, which are polyphonic and highly musical, are also intrinsically hypnotic, and can easily entrance an unsuspecting xenosophont. 
### Life Cycle & Reblooming 
Ancestral affini, on the homeworld, once reproduced through a symbiotic relationship with [[beeple|beeple]], the sophont species they co-evolved with. By entrancing and domesticating proto-beeple, who would cuddle with them and become covered in their pollen, the proto-affini ensured that their pollen would be spread to other beeple and other affini. Pollination, as a result, has a somewhat lewd connotation in Affini society. This ancestral reproductive process is also the ultimate origin of the affini impulse to domestication other sophont life.

Modern affini are typically created through a process of uplifting nonsophont plant-like life forms. While the variety of plant they were uplifted from may influence the resulting affini (for example, a carnivorous plant may natively possess the capability to eat meat), the resulting sophont is still very much an affini.

Regardless of origin, the standard affini life cycle is a presentient "zeroth" Bloom, which eventually reblooms (see below) into a sophont affini's First Bloom. This affini is then cared for and educated, and is considered an adolescent for roughly the next 40-80 years, at which point they begin to take up their role in [[affini-compact|Compact]] society.

> The community's rules prohibit children and adolescents onscreen in any HDG work; consequently, depicting affini in their adolescent stage of life is also prohibited. Please don't do it! 

The affini core is extremely durable and difficult to injure, but the rest of their body is susceptible to damage and injury from a variety of sources. A sufficient amount of damage will "kill" an affini, in that it will render their unable to maintain their body in a coherent form. When this happens, an affini *reblooms*, a process that may take as little as an hour and as much as several years. During this time, the core regenerates any injuries it may have sustained and constructed a new body for itself out of locally available foliage. The process is strenuous and requires focus and concentration, so the affini is functionally sessile for the duration. Occasionally, reblooming may cause gaps in memory, changes in personality, or other differences. Thanks to the core's durability, this makes it extremely difficult to actually permanently kill an affini.

Reblooming may also occur due to age; eventually an affini's phytotech body is unable to repair itself, and the regenerative process of reblooming allows them to effectively reset themselves to zero physiologically. Barring serious injury, this occurs roughly every 300 years.

Because they are otherwise functionally immortal, and because timekeeping is highly variable both due to differences in local calendars and the issues caused by relativity, affini measure their lives in Blooms. First through Third Blooms are extremely common on the front lines of the domestication effort, with older Blooms becoming progressively rarer as the Bloom count rises.
## Culture & History 
Affini society is synonymous with the [[affini-compact|Affini Compact]] — they are the animating force behind the Compact, and the culture in ultimate control of it. Their viewpoint defines reality within the Compact, and they exemplify the Compact's virtues.

That said, their day-to-day lives are as varied as any sophont culture's are. There are affini artists, affini technicians, affini florists, affini physicians, affini clerks (there are a _lot_ of clerks in particular), and so on. Affini are highly communal and, thanks to their advanced technology, are able to automate virtually anything they don't want to actually do themselves — and there's almost always someone interested in doing one task or another. 

The main commonality shared by all affini is a dedication to the common task of universal [[florets-domestication|domestication]]. Every affini is encouraged and expected to do their part, even if their part is simply ensuring that the ship they live on has a healthy environmental subsystem. Many affini, however, go beyond simply doing their part, and actively participate in individual, personal domestication — in other words, they claim a floret.
### Florets

*Main Article: [[florets-domestication|Florets & Domestication]]*

As discussed above, Affini co-evolved with [[beeple|beeple]]. This symbiosis grew beyond mere biological need and into a cultural tie as the two species reached sophonce, as affini bonded with beeple beyond the mere necessities of reproduction. They came to love their beeple as companions, as pets, whom they doted upon and spared no expense in lavishing praise and affection upon. The beeple were subordinate, yes, but they were given everything they could possibly desire. 

And then, when the Affini looked out into the broader universe and discovered that there were _other_ sophonts out there, they decided that they loved these new sophonts enough to treat them just the same.

A **floret** is a member of a xenosophont species who has, voluntarily or otherwise, ceded their right to legal personhood in the Compact. They are the property of an affini, who is responsible for their care and wellbeing. They cannot vote (at least, not in a formal way), but their desires and needs are central to their owner's world. It is in no way an exaggeration to say that florets are considered the most important individuals in the entire Affini Compact, because an affini will do anything to make their florets' lives better.
### The Compact
*Main Article: [[affini-compact|Affini Compact]]*

The **Affini Compact** is the greatest creation of the Affini, a self-sustaining non-hierarchical civilization connected by a bureaucracy that observes, records, coordinates, but does not control the lives of everyone and everything it touches. The Compact is nothing less than the manifestation of the collective wish of the Affini to make the universe a better place for all the adorable little xenosophonts that live within it.
