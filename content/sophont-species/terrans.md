_Not to be confused by the primary polity terrans lived under at the time of their domestication, the [[terran-accord|Terran Accord]]._

> _“'So, you’re a Terran. What’s that like?' The xeno asked, still crunching away at the leg. Astrid had no idea how to respond to that, so she didn’t say anything. 'Done annyyyyyy… persistence hunting lately? Pack-bonded with any interesting inanimate objects?'"_

**Terrans** (also known as **humans**) are bipedal primates from the Orion Spur of the Milky Way. Generally, they stand between 1.5 and 2 meters, although those adapted for lower gravities are known to exceed this. Terrans are notable for their overland endurance, throwing abilities, their distinctive hair on their head, and their bonding instincts.
### Quick Info
**Homeworld**: Terra, historically known as Earth  
**Home System**: [[sol|Sol]]  
**Native Gravity:** 1.0g  
**Year Length:** 365 Terran standard days

**Lifespan:** Wild terrans lived on average 70-80 years, but independents in the Terran Protectorate can live to twice that. [[florets-domestication|Florets]] can potentially live as long as three centuries.  
**Circadian Rhythm:** ~24 hours  
**Domesticated:** 2554 CE (0 BD)

**Names:** TODO
## Appearance & Physiology

The affini has a vine wrapped around the terran and the two's faces are close to one another as they look into each others' eyes." >}}
    Many terrans in the Compact get biomods to give them features of other creatures from their homeworld and beyond.

Terrans are omnivorous bipedal primates with long limbs and expressive, flattened faces. Though otherwise largely hairless, one of the most immediately distinguishing features among terrans is the fur that grows on the top of their heads, which come in a variety of colors, lengths and textures. Terrans style, groom and color their head-fur according to countless unique cultural practices, as well as personal preference. Their relatively thin, smooth skin comes in warm earth tones, ranging anywhere from shades of dark brown to pale beige. Male terrans are on average somewhat larger than females, and tend to grow additional fur around the mouth and jaw, which is also styled and groomed.

Terrans have an excellent sense of balance despite their lack of a tail. Their upright bipedal gait, as well as their ability to shed excess body heat through sweating, allowed their ancestors to specialize as persistence hunters, and terrans therefore have excellent overland endurance. Their forelimbs are also highly adapted for throwing objects accurately over long distances. Both of these advantages were crucial to early humans and their extinct evolutionary relatives, seeing as they do not have any natural armor or weaponry to defend themselves. Their teeth are short and blunt, and their claws almost entirely vestigial.

Ancestral terrans clad themselves in animal skins and furs to protect themselves against the elements, and weaved together plant matter to form textiles. The extensive use of textiles for both protection and fashion is a staple of terran culture, and in the wild they often had strict cultural rules and taboos about the styling and amount of textiles to wear.
### Bonding
Terrans have a powerful packbonding instinct, known to them as anthropomorphism, which leads them to project human thoughts, emotions and characteristics on not only other sophonts, but also non-sapient animals and even inanimate objects. This instinct, combined with their natural pattern-recognition behavior, means that terrans will quickly form strong emotional attachments to just about anything by virtue of their natural neurology, where most xenosophonts would require external bonding enhancers. Affini owners are therefore advised to be conservative in their use of class-C xenodrugs on Terrans.
