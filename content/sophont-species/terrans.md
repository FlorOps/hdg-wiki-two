**Terrans** (also known as **humans**) are bipedal primates from the Orion Spur of the Milky Way. Generally, they stand between 1.5 and 2 meters, although those adapted for lower gravities are known to exceed this. Terrans are notable for their overland endurance, throwing abilities, their distinctive hair on their head, and their bonding instincts.
### Quick Info
**Homeworld**: Terra, historically known as Earth  
**Home System**: [[sol|Sol]]  
**Native Gravity:** 1.0g  
**Year Length:** 365 Terran standard days

**Lifespan:** Wild terrans lived on average 70-80 years, but independents in the Terran Protectorate can live to twice that. [[florets-domestication|Florets]] can potentially live as long as three centuries.  
**Circadian Rhythm:** ~24 hours  
**Domesticated:** 2554 CE (0 BD)

**Names:** TODO
## Appearance & Physiology

The affini has a vine wrapped around the terran and the two's faces are close to one another as they look into each others' eyes." >}}

Terrans are omnivorous bipedal primates with long limbs and expressive, flattened faces. Though otherwise largely hairless, one of the most immediately distinguishing features among terrans is the fur that grows on the top of their heads, which come in a variety of colors, lengths and textures. Terrans style, groom and color their head-fur according to countless unique cultural practices, as well as personal preference. Their relatively thin, smooth skin comes in warm earth tones, ranging anywhere from shades of dark brown to pale beige. Male terrans are on average somewhat larger than females, and tend to grow additional fur around the mouth and jaw, which is also styled and groomed.

Terrans have an excellent sense of balance despite their lack of a tail. Their upright bipedal gait, as well as their ability to shed excess body heat through sweating, allowed their ancestors to specialize as persistence hunters, and terrans therefore have excellent overland endurance. Their forelimbs are also highly adapted for throwing objects accurately over long distances. Both of these advantages were crucial to early humans and their extinct evolutionary relatives, seeing as they do not have any natural armor or weaponry to defend themselves. Their teeth are short and blunt, and their claws almost entirely vestigial.

Ancestral terrans clad themselves in animal skins and furs to protect themselves against the elements, and weaved together plant matter to form textiles. The extensive use of textiles for both protection and fashion is a staple of terran culture, and in the wild they often had strict cultural rules and taboos about the styling and amount of textiles to wear.
### Bonding
Terrans have a powerful packbonding instinct, known to them as anthropomorphism, which leads them to project human thoughts, emotions and characteristics on not only other sophonts, but also non-sapient animals and even inanimate objects. This instinct, combined with their natural pattern-recognition behavior, means that terrans will quickly form strong emotional attachments to just about anything by virtue of their natural neurology, where most xenosophonts would require external bonding enhancers. Affini owners are therefore advised to be conservative in their use of class-C xenodrugs on Terrans.
## Culture & History
For much of their history, Terrans lived in small, semi-nomadic bands largely organized along familial lines; however, about 12,500 BD, Terrans began a transition to sedentary, agricultural-based organization. This tendency spread out from several centers of activity concurrently, eventually overtaking the entirety of Terra. 

Roughly 750 years BD, Terrans began to radically alter their environment due to mass adoption of industrialized production without sufficient safety protocols, leading to successive blights, climate change, and eventually mass extinctions and broader ecological collapse. This provided a strong motivation for Terrans to expand into neighboring star systems in the Orion Spur using rudimentary hypermetric displacement engines. 

Terran culture is a veritable cornucopia of diverse ways of life, some rooted in deep traditions, some derived from adaptation to new and challenging conditions. Paradoxically, Terran pack-bonding instincts can also result in a very strong in-group/out-group division; consequently, Terrans in large numbers have a tendency to split and form new groups. Across Terran history, there have been numerous styles of governance, spanning the range from mutualistic to authoritarian. 

Beginning roughly concurrently with the development of industry (c. 700 BD), Terran culture increasingly fell under the sway of a toxic meme-complex known as **capitalism**. The Terran variant of this meme was highly contagious and encouraged anti-social hoarding behavior that allowed a handful of individuals to amass tremendous amounts of **wealth**, which they then used to distort public policy. This generated tremendous selection pressure for vertically-stratified and highly centralized authoritarian modes of government, which are easier for small groups to control.

Between c. 600 and 70 BD, several hegemonic powers successively rose to dominate first Terra, then Terran space, each collapsing in turn due to inescapable contradictions imposed by capitalism. The latest variant, the Terran Accord, was established at the end of this period, and endured until it was formally disbanded during domestication. 

Just prior to domestication, Terrans were living in a region of space roughly one-thousand light years across. Without access to reliable faster-than-light communications beyond directly conveying data with a starship equipped with a hypermetric displacement engine, outlying Terran settlements often experienced rapid cultural drift. However, virtually all were still carrying the capitalism meme-complex, and the vast majority were tied into a system of economic extraction that funneled resources and power to an increasingly powerful stratum of society at the expense of all others. The average Terran, just prior to domestication, experienced dangerous levels of stress, unhappiness, lack of fulfillment, social atomization, and inadequate or no access to health care. Most considered the acquisition of material wealth to be their primary purpose in life, or at the very least a necessary priority to ameliorate the problems caused by capitalism itself.

> Due to Terran development and overuse of generative large language model algorithms, the pool of historical documentation for the period roughly including 500-100 years BD is poisoned with hallucinatory data. The Bureau of Neoxenoveterinary Archeobureaucracy is currently engaged in an intensive effort to identify accurate documentation of the historical record!
